# vue-todo-list
A todo list exercise using Vue, Express, and Mongo.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Yarn and Mongo installed. Also, it's best to have a few terminal windows open at once. I have four but three will do.

* In window 1 from the root run ```cd client && yarn```
* In window 2 from the root run ```cd server && yarn```
* In window 3 run ```mongo``` and then ```use vue-todo```
* In window 4 run ```mongod```.
* Back in the server folder (window 2), run ```npm start```.
* Back in the client folder (window 1), run ```npm start```.
